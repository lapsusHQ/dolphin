# Event Store DB

EventStoreDB is an open-source state-transition database, designed for businesses that are ready to harness the true power of event-driven architecture. It is a purpose-built database for event-driven applications, with a focus on high performance, scalability, and reliability.

This project is a little playground for me to learn more about EventStoreDB and how to use it in a Scala application, using the [EventStoreDB Java for Scala](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStoreDB-Client-Java) client.
